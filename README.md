# 42 Cursus Projects

>This is a repository of all of my 42 project starting from february 2024.

## Libft
Description:

Write your own library: a collection of functions that will be a useful tool for your cursus.

The repository: https://github.com/magoubb2/42-Cursus/tree/main/libft

#### In the libft project at 42 school, students are tasked with creating their own library of functions. The project consists of two main parts:
### Reimplementation of Standard C Library Functions:

>In this part, students write their own versions of commonly used functions found in the Standard C Library, such as strlen, strcpy, and strdup. This exercise allows students to gain a deeper understanding of how these functions work and how they can be implemented from scratch.

### Creation of Custom Functions:

>In the second part, students are required to implement additional functions that are not part of the Standard C Library. These functions are often specified only by their behavior or purpose, and students must write code to fulfill these requirements.This part of the project challenges students to think creatively and problem-solve independently.

#### Overall, the libft project not only reinforces students'understanding of fundamental programming concepts but also hones their skills in algorithmic thinking and software development.
