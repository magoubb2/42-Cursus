## Libft :book:
Description:

Write your own library: a collection of functions that will be a useful tool for your cursus.

>The repository: https://github.com/magoubb2/42-Cursus/tree/main/libft

#### In the libft project at 42 school, students are tasked with creating their own library of functions. The project consists of two main parts:
### Reimplementation of Standard C Library Functions:

>In this part, students write their own versions of commonly used functions found in the Standard C Library, such as strlen, strcpy, and strdup. This exercise allows students to gain a deeper understanding of how these functions work and how they can be implemented from scratch.

### Creation of Custom Functions:

>In the second part, students are required to implement additional functions that are not part of the Standard C Library. These functions are often specified only by their behavior or purpose, and students must write code to fulfill these requirements.This part of the project challenges students to think creatively and problem-solve independently.

#### Overall, the libft project not only reinforces students'understanding of fundamental programming concepts but also hones their skills in algorithmic thinking and software development.

## Get_next_line 📝
Description:

This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

>The repository: https://github.com/magoubb2/42-Cursus/tree/main/get_next_line

#### The get_next_line function is a project assignment at 42 school. It is designed to read from a file descriptor (fd) line by line until the end of the file (EOF). The function dynamically allocates memory as needed to store each line read from the file descriptor and returns it to the caller.

>The get_next_line function is useful for reading input from files, particularly when the length of the lines is unknown or potentially very large. It is a fundamental tool for file input processing in C programming.

In the get_next_line project at 42 school, students are tasked with implementing a function to read from file descriptors efficiently and securely. The function has the following features:

### Reading Line by Line:
>The get_next_line function reads from a file descriptor until it encounters a newline character ('\n') or reaches the end of the file (EOF). It returns each line read from the file descriptor.
### Dynamic Memory Allocation:
>Memory is dynamically allocated as needed to store the lines read from the file descriptor. This allows for flexible handling of input data of varying lengths.
### Error Handling:
>Proper error handling is implemented to handle cases such as invalid file descriptors, memory allocation failures, and reading errors. The function returns NULL in case of errors.

Overall, the get_next_line project provides students with practical experience in file I/O operations and memory management in the C programming language. It challenges students to write efficient, robust, and portable code while adhering to the project requirements and guidelines.

## Ft_printf 🖨
Description:

The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().
